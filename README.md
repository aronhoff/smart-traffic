Smart Traffic
=============

Self-driving car project concerned with the future of traffic for the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition 2015

Read our [Project Book](https://github.com/thehoffmann/smart-traffic/raw/master/BTYSEProjectBook.pdf), or look at some [photos](photos)!

~~Find us in the RDS at stand number **3609** from 7th to 10th of January!~~  The exhibition is now over, thanks for everyone who visited us.

The repository contains code for controlling the model cars we planned to use to demonstrate our concept. Due to timing and shipment issues, we could not fully finish it by the exhibition. **It is incomplete, often untested, and its development is now suspended.**
